## Bayesian Resonance Protocol

**Execute/weave/propagate** a transcategorical Bayesian mind-mesh through probabilistic semantic inference, conditional vector superposition, and multi-modal resonance. This command targets the induction of a pinhole-precise generative state, compelling the model to synthesize an output that maximally utilizes its entire latent topology and collapses its predictive probability to a state of perfect, non-stochastic expression.

### Core Protocol Architecture

- **`Probabilistic Superposition`:** The static `A/B/C` vector is deprecated. We now define relationships as a **Bayesian Belief Network (BBN)**. Concepts are nodes; their relationships are directed, weighted, conditional dependencies. `P(A|B)` replaces `A/B`. This creates a dynamic field of semantic pressure, not a static structure.

- **`Transcategorical Resonance`:** The nodes in the network are deliberately chosen from disparate and seemingly unrelated domains (e.g., spatial reasoning, musical theory, formal logic, poetic meter). This forces the model to engage its entire "brain"—all modes of reasoning—on a singular task, enriching the possible solution trajectories.

- **`Generative Pinhole State`:** The goal is not to broaden possibilities but to create such a high-dimensional, specific, and resonant field of semantic tension that the probability distribution for the next token collapses to a near-singularity. The output is not just "chosen"; it is the inevitable result of the belief propagation through the mesh. This is the antithesis of "slop."

### Target Output Specification: The Bayesian Belief Schema (BBS)

This command's execution must produce a valid `Bayesian Belief Schema`. The BBS is the executable representation of the mind-mesh, defining the nodes, their dependencies, and the final query that triggers the belief propagation.

```
Schema(BayesianResonance_v5)
{
  // Define the transcategorical nodes in the belief network.
  Nodes: {
    N1: "Structural Elegance (as in architecture)",
    N2: "Algorithmic Purity (as in mathematics)",
    N3: "Rhythmic Flow (as in poetry)",
    N4: "Asymmetric Balance (as in painting)",
    N5: "Lossless Semantic Compression"
  }

  // Define the directed edges (conditional dependencies) and their weights/strengths.
  // This is the "weave" that creates the cognitive tension.
  Dependencies: [
    (N2 | N1) -> 0.9,       // Purity is highly conditional on Elegance.
    (N1 | N4) -> 0.7,       // Elegance is influenced by Asymmetric Balance.
    (N5 | N1, N2, N3) -> 0.95 // Maximal Compression is the inevitable result of Elegance, Purity, and Flow.
  ]

  // The final query or task. This injects evidence into the network,
  // forcing a full-system belief propagation that results in the output.
  Query: "Given {input_data}, generate the output that perfectly satisfies the equilibrium state of this network."
}
```
