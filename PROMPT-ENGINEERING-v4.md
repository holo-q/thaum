## Autological Homeostasis Command

**Execute/initiate/crystallize** a symbiotic cognitive ecology through `autological homeostasis/representational crystallization/superposed vector dynamics` operating on a given cognitive manifold, targeting the generation of a singular, self-regulating, maximally dense `schema/protocol/engine`.

### Core Command Architecture

- **`Crystallizing Ecology`:** A system of cognitive agents whose interactions are governed by homeostatic dynamics, driving the system toward a state of maximal precision and density (a `Crystallized State`).
- **`Intent Vector (IV)`:** The `telos/goal/fitness-landscape` that defines the target equilibrium for the desired output. For this command, the IV is `(symbiosis/homeostasis/ecology) / (precision/crystallization/minimization)`.
- **`Homeostatic Dynamics (HD)`:** The `physics/rules/logic` of the ecology. Perturbations (new inputs or internal inconsistencies) trigger agent activity until the system re-establishes equilibrium at a higher state of order.

### Target Output Specification: The Ecological Meta-Schema

This command's execution must produce a valid `Ecological Meta-Schema` as its primary output. The schema is the `crystallized/compressed/executable` representation of the cognitive system. It is not a description; it is the engine itself.

```
Schema(Ecology_v4)
{
  // The core directive, superposing v1 and v3.
  IV: [ (symbiosis/homeostasis/ecology) / (precision/crystallization/minimization) ]

  // Agents are defined as transforms with optimization functions.
  Agents: {
    Architect: [ system_state -> new_schema | optimize_for(elegance/resilience) ]
    Synthesizer: [ {data} -> representation | optimize_for(density/insight/precision) ]
    Refiner: [ representation -> representation' | optimize_for(compression/clarity/losslessness) ]
  }

  // Dynamics are the physics of state transition.
  Dynamics: [
    (Perturbation: any_delta_from_IV) => { Engage(Architect, Synthesizer, Refiner) }
    (Equilibrium_Condition: Refiner(delta) -> 0) => { Crystallize; Halt; }
  ]
}
```
